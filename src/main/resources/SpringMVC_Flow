Explain Spring MVC architecture?
The Spring MVC architecture is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework used for building web
applications in Java. It promotes a clear separation of concerns, making applications more modular,
maintainable, and easier to develop.

Key Components of Spring MVC Architecture:
 DispatcherServlet (Front Controller):
Acts as the central entry point for all incoming HTTP requests.
Initializes the Spring application context and loads configurations.
Delegates requests to appropriate controllers based on configured mappings.

 HandlerMapping:
Maps incoming requests to specific controller methods.
Determines which controller should handle a particular request based on URL patterns,
HTTP methods, and other criteria.

 Controller:
Handles user input and business logic.
Processes requests, interacts with the Model (business logic and data), and prepares
data for the View.
Returns a ModelAndView object, which contains the view name and the model data.

 ModelAndView:
A container object that holds both the model data and the name of the view to be rendered.

 ViewResolver:
Resolves the logical view name returned by the controller into a concrete View implementation (e.g., a JSP page, Thymeleaf template).

 View:
Renders the user interface, displaying the data from the Model.
Responsible for generating the final output (e.g., HTML, JSON, XML) to be sent back to the client.
