STEP 1: Initialize a new Git repository : Creates a new local Git repository in your current project folder.
git init

STEP 2: Check Git status : Shows which files are new, modified, or staged (ready to commit).
git status

STEP 3: Add files to staging : Adds all files (new or modified) to Git’s “staging area”.
git add .

You can also add specific files:
git add src/main/java/com/suvarna/dsa/arrays/ReverseArray.java

STEP 4: Commit your changes:  Saves your staged changes locally with a message describing what you did.
git commit -m "Initial setup for DSA concept"

STEP 5: Add a remote GitHub repository:  Connects your local repo to your GitHub repository (the remote destination).
git remote add origin https://github.com/RathodSuvarna/DSA_coding.git

STEP 6: Rename your default branch to main: Ensures your local branch name is main (same as on GitHub).
git branch -M main

STEP 7: Push your local code to GitHub: Uploads all your commits to GitHub.
The -u sets the default remote branch, so next time you can just run git push.
git push -u origin main

AFTER INITIAL SETUP (Daily use):
Once your project is connected to GitHub, you’ll just repeat these when you make changes:

1️⃣ See what changed:
git status

2️⃣ Stage changes:
git add .

3️⃣ Commit with a message:
git commit -m "Added DSA problem - reverse string"

4️⃣ Push to GitHub:
git push

Command	What it does
git log	Shows commit history
git diff	Shows what’s changed before committing
git pull	Updates your local repo with changes from GitHub
git rm <file>	Removes a file from Git tracking
git restore <file>	Restores a file to the last committed version
